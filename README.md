Three conservative scenarios to test property resilience:

- **DSCR:** ≥ 1.25

Properties passing all three hurdles are marked with ✓ in green.

## 🧮 Calculation Methodology

### Cash Flow Formula
```
Gross Rent + Other Income
- Vacancy Loss (% of gross income)
= Effective Gross Income

- Property Tax
- Insurance
- HOA Fees
- Property Management (% of gross rent)
- Maintenance Reserve (% of gross rent)
- CapEx Reserve (% of gross rent)
- Utilities
= Net Operating Income (NOI)

- Annual Debt Service (P&I payments)
= Annual Cash Flow
```

### Key Metrics
- **Cash-on-Cash Return** = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
- **Cap Rate** = (NOI / Purchase Price) × 100
- **DSCR** = NOI / Annual Debt Service

### 10-Year Projections
- Rent increases by growth rate % each year
- Fixed expenses (tax, insurance) grow by expense growth rate
- Variable expenses (mgmt, maint, capex) calculated as % of current rent
- Property value compounds by appreciation rate
- Principal paydown calculated monthly with accurate amortization
- Equity = Property Value - Remaining Loan Balance
